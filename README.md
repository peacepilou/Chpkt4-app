# SlamCoffee

I had 2 days to create a fullstack project. For the backend, I used Java (Spring/JPA/Hibernate) in order to create a RestApi. For the frontend, I used Angular.
This frontend is currently online and hosted by Fiebase : https://checkpoint4-5a164.web.app/

I still haven't hosted my backend so my frontend is currlently pointing on localhost:8080. I you want to have the whole view of this project, please clone my backend repository : https://github.com/peacepilou/SlamCoffee-api. Until backend is deployed, you shloud know how spring/jpa/hibernate works...

Step 1 : create a database with the name "trainingChkpt4" <br>
Step 2 : be careful to the application.properties : maybe you should point your localhost on a different port than 3306 (depending on how you've created your mysql local instance) <br>
Step 3 : run the command "mvn-spring-boot:run"

Hope it will work for you ! :)
